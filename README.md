## Introduction:
**Project Title**: Covid19 Vaccine Supply Management using Blockchain.  

**Problem Statement:** In the context of current Covid-19 pandemic, Rapid rollout of a vaccine and the implementation of a worldwide immunization campaign is critical for the control of the pandemic. Preparing and planning for mass immunization becomes extremely important. Nevertheless, there are several aspects that are likely to affect the success of COVID-19 immunization program if they are not properly addressed.

1.Availability of an operational and transparent end-to-end supply chain and logistics systems.    
2.Its role is on one hand to assure the vaccine storage and stock management and on the other hand the rigorous temperature control in the cold chain.    
3.Transparency and correctness in the registration and management of the waiting list of people for immunization.    
4.Building trust in vaccine by implementing a transparent and public reporting systems of potential side effects including the automatic tracing back up vaccine lot level.   

**Our Solution:** A blockchain-based system for transparent and correct tracing of COVID-19 vaccine registration, storage and delivery, and side effects self-reporting.
Our Blockchain based solution will offer:

1.This decentralized smart contracts-based monitoring solution will assuring proper vaccine transportation conditions in a cold chain and real time awareness of all peers in relation to the fulfillment of COVID-19 vaccine delivery and storage conditions.    
2.This blockchain based solution will provide data immutability, transparency and correctness of beneficiary registration for vaccination, eliminating identity thefts and impersonations.    
3.Our blockchain solution will provide vaccine administration and transparent and tamper proof self-reporting of side effects, person identification and vaccine association.
